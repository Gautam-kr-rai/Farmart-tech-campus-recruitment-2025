# Discussion on Log Processing

## ðŸ“Œ Challenges
1. **Large File Handling**  
   - Directly loading large log files into memory can cause performance issues.
   - Solution: Stream processing instead of reading the entire file at once.

2. **Efficient Searching**
   - Searching for specific date logs needs optimized filtering.
   - Solution: Use regex-based line filtering to extract required logs.

3. **Storage Considerations**
   - Logs can grow large over time.
   - Solution: Store processed logs in a structured `output/` directory.

## ðŸ”§ Future Enhancements
- Implement a database (MongoDB/PostgreSQL) for faster log queries.
- Add a simple frontend for log searching.
- Optimize extraction script for multi-threading.
